                    <p><strong>1. Visitor Analytics</strong></p>
                    <p>Visitor Analytics&nbsp;is a simple website analytics service which measures the traffic on our website and website visitors' general details. We collect statistics like which pages visitors visit and when, where they are approximately located, where they land first or if they are coming from a specific referral, to make our website visitors' experience better .</p><p>As a website operator using Visitor Analytics,&nbsp;we process<strong></strong>information about our visitors' device type and screen size/resolution, approximate location, browser, OS, IPs, page visits, bounce rate, conversions, conversion funnels, average sessions per visitor, average pages per session, average session duration, time spent on the website and preferably visited content on the website. All this data is pseudonymized and Visitor Analytics will not use the collected data to identify individual users or to match the data with additional information on an individual user.<br><br><strong>We do not use cookies to collect this data</strong>. Instead, we use the so-called fingerprinting technology that does not require placing any cookies, files or technology on your device. Fingerprinting relies on your device’s technical attributes and combines them to identify your device as a unique device and allow for reliable analytics.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Visitor Recordings</strong></p><p>Visitor Recordings&nbsp;is an additional feature to Visitor Analytics (described above) in the form of a simple website replay tool that records in statistics where our website visitors scrolled to and what they clicked on our website. We can see this information in playbacks and so called “heatmaps”. Collecting these statistics helps us to make our website more user-friendly as well as to reproduce and fix technical errors.</p><p>Basically, as a website operator using Visitor Recordings, we are using a snippet of tracking code to collect data about our visitors’ journey on our websites, which subpages they visit, what they clicked on, where they moved their mouse cursor to and where they scrolled. All this data is pseudonymized and Visitor Analytics will not use the collected data to identify individual users or to match it with additional information on an individual user.</p></div></div>
